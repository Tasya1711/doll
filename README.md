# Doll Game
A fun virtual doll creator built with **Electron**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — customize your doll’s skin, hair, outfit, and even give her a name!
# Introduction
Doll Maker is a playful desktop app made with **Electron**.

Users can personalize a cute virtual doll by choosing:  
🎨 Skin color  
💇‍♀️ Hair color  
👗 Outfit  

All changes are saved, so you can keep your unique creation. If you want to start fresh, there’s a **Return Changes** button that restores the doll to its original look. You can also give your doll a name, which will appear above her head. 

This project was created purely for fun and to practice building interactive desktop apps with **Electron**.
